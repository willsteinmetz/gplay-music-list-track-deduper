# gplay-music-list-track-deduper

Frustrated with Google Play Music Manager duplicating all of the tracks on your playlist when you have to force it to re-upload your library because it constantly derps when you download a track in your iTunes playlists that was originall in the cloud? Yeah, same here.

This node script removes duplicate tracks from Google Play Music playlists.

## Usage

```shell
npm install
node index.js
```

## Use at your own risk

__This script is destructive! By using this script, you are taking full responsibility of any and all changes that are made to your playlists and tracks in your Google Play Music account. I assume no responsibility for your use of this script. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!__
